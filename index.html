                                Mouth Disease (HFMD) in infants and children. The research leverages deep neural
                                networks, specifically an ensemble learning approach, to enhance robustness and accuracy
                                in HFMD identification. The meta-model combines predictions from pre-trained neural
                                network architectures, aiming to overcome limitations posed by sparse data and diverse
                                symptom presentations. Our goals include improving HFMD detection precision and
                                comprehensiveness. Results demonstrate the approachâ€™s effectiveness, achieving a notable
                                94% accuracy on a dedicated test set.</p>

                            <p>Peptic ulcers and other digestive tract disorders pose significant diagnostic challenges,
                                often requiring expert analysis of endoscopic images. In this study, we aim to assist in
                                the examination of gastrointestinal (GI) tract endoscopy images using advanced image
                                classification techniques. Utilizing the Kvasir dataset, which comprises 3500 labeled
                                images, we applied Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image
                                preprocessing to enhance feature extraction. We implemented convolutional neural
                                networks (CNNs) with InceptionV3 and ResNet50V2 architectures to classify endoscopic
                                images into four categories: normal, esophagitis, polyps, and ulcerative colitis. Our
                                model achieved a training accuracy of 100.00% and a validation accuracy of 92.71%,

                            <p>The rose is one of the worldâ€™s most significant flowers, which is cultivated widely. But,
                                it is susceptible to various types of diseases that can lead to a substantial reduction
                                in yield. Hence, early detection of these diseases is essential to avoid risk and ensure
                                timely treatment. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach to detect rose
                                leaf disease at an early stage using the YOLO model variants (YOLOv5 and YOLOv8).
                                Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8 has achieved 71% precision, 65.1% recall,
                                and 66.3% mAP(50), whereas YOLOv5 achieved 70% precision, 60% recall, and 66.4% mAP(50).

                                    <p class="card-text">The Ride Sharing Simulation System aims to simulate and
                                        optimize the operation of a ride-sharing network. The system is designed to
                                        model real-world factors such as traffic conditions, vehicle availability, user
                                        demand, and route optimization to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness
                                        of ride-sharing services.</p>
                                    <ul class="mt-auto">
                                        <li><strong>Demand and Supply Modeling:</strong> Simulated real-world scenarios
                                            of ride requests and available vehicles, accounting for time, location, and
                                            user preferences to match riders with drivers.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Traffic and Route Optimization:</strong> Incorporated traffic
                                            congestion models and real-time road conditions to optimize routes, reducing
                                            wait times and travel distances.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing Model:</strong> Developed a dynamic pricing system
                                            that adjusts fares based on demand, time of day, traffic conditions, and
                                            other relevant factors to maximize revenue and ensure fairness.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Vehicle Assignment Algorithm:</strong> Implemented an algorithm to
                                            match vehicles with riders efficiently, minimizing idle times and ensuring
                                            that both drivers and passengers are satisfied with the service.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Simulation Engine:</strong> Built a simulation engine using Python
                                            and SimPy, allowing users to test different scenarios such as peak hours,
                                            sudden surges in demand, and varying traffic conditions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Integrated real-time data from
                                            external sources (e.g., traffic reports, weather conditions) to simulate
                                            real-world scenarios and provide accurate performance metrics.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Measured key performance indicators
                                            (KPIs) such as average wait time, ride duration, vehicle utilization, and
                                            customer satisfaction to assess the system's efficiency.</li>
                                        <li><strong>System Scalability:</strong> Designed the system to be scalable,
                                            allowing it to accommodate large-scale simulations with many riders and
                                            vehicles in diverse geographical areas.</li>
                                        <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Developed a user-friendly interface for
                                            simulating various scenarios, adjusting parameters like demand, supply,
                                            traffic conditions, and pricing models to test the system's performance
                                            under different circumstances.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Results Visualization:</strong> Provided real-time visualization of
                                            simulation results, including graphical representations of route
                                            optimization, demand-supply balance, and pricing changes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Optimization Algorithms:</strong> Used optimization techniques, such
                                            as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, to further enhance vehicle
                                            routing and resource allocation strategies.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Data Analysis & Reporting:</strong> Included detailed reports that
                                            summarize simulation results and offer insights into the effectiveness of
                                            different ride-sharing strategies, helping improve system design and
                                            decision-making.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Security & Privacy Considerations:</strong> Ensured the privacy and
                                            security of user data, including implementing anonymization protocols for
                                            location and ride details to protect user identities during simulations.
                                        </li>
